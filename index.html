					<p>"The best part of working at InsideSales.com is the atmosphere – management really invests in each employee. When I first started, I wasn't the strongest sales rep on the floor. My manager mentored me and provided me with sales tips that have enabled me to succeed. Now I'm among the top of the BDS team in performance. InsideSales.com teaches you skills that are taking the industry to the next level.”</p>
